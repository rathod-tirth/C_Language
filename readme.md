# C Language

- It was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories.

- C is a mid-level language since it doesn't provide all the functionality found in high level languages but it provides you with all the building blocks that you will need to produce the results you want.

- C is a mid-level language since it provides all the functionality required for low-level programming with high-level feature like functions and array.

### Preprocessor Directive :

- A preprocessor directive is a command in C and C++ programming languages that is processed by the preprocessor before the actual compilation of the code.

- Preprocessor directives are lines in the source code that begin with a `#` symbol. They are not considered part of the regular C or C++ syntax and are not processed by the compiler itself. 

- `#include` is a preprocessor directive in the C and C++ programming languages. It is used to include the contents of another file into the source code during the compilation process.

### Header Files :

- C language has numerous libraries which contain predefined functions to make programming easier. Header files contain predefined standard library functions. 

- All header files must have a ‘.h’ extension. Header files contain function definitions, data type definitions, and macros which can be imported with the help of the preprocessor directive `#include`.

- `stdio.h`: It is a header file in the C programming language that stands for **standard input-output header**. It contains declarations for input and output functions used for tasks like reading from the keyboard, writing on the screen, and working with files.

### Comment : 

- A comment in programming is a piece of text that is not executed as part of the program but is included in the source code to provide explanations, annotations, or information for human readers. 

- Comments are ignored by the compiler or interpreter and have no impact on the actual execution of the program.

### main() :

- `int main()` is the entry point of a C program. It is a special function that servers as the starting point of program execution.

- The `return 0;` statement in the `main` function is a convention used to indicate successful execution of the program. 

### Scope :

- The term "scope" refers to the region or context in a program where a particular variable or identifier is visible and can be accessed. The scope of a variable determines where in the program the variable is valid and can be used.

- There are mainly three types of scope : Block scope, Function scope and Global scope.

### Identifier : 

- An identifier is a name given to a variable, function, class or any other user-defined item in the source code. Identifiers are used to uniquely identify and refer to these items within a program.

- Rules for forming valid identifier : 
   1. Composed of characters (uppercase or lowercase), digits and underscore. 

   2. No spaces, start with a letter or underscore

   3. Case-sensitive.

## Keywords:

- Predefined or reserved words in C language.

- You cannot have a variable named as keywords.

- C has 32 keywords.

## Data Types:

1. `int`: 

2. `float`: 

3. `char`: 

4. `array`: 

- Identifier in C can consist of digits ,letters or underscore with either letter or underscore as a first character.

- String is an array of characters in C that ends with null character '\0'. Null character defines the end of the string.

- Scope in a programming language is the block or region where a defined variable will have its existence and beyond that region, the variable has no existence.
