# C Language

- It was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories

- C is the succesor of language B, C89 and C99 were previous version of C

- C is a mid-level language since it doesn't provide all the functionality found in high level languages but it provides you with all the building blocks that you will need to produce the results you want.

- Identifier in C can consist of digits ,letters or underscore with either letter or underscore as a first character.

- String is an array of characters in C that ends with null character '\0'. Null character defines the end of the string.

- Scope in a programming language is the block or region where a defined variable will have its existence and beyond that region, the variable has no existence.

## Header Files :

- C language has numerous libraries which contain predefined functions to make programming easier. Header files contain predefined standard library functions. 

- All header files must have a ‘.h’ extension. Header files contain function definitions, data type definitions, and macros which can be imported with the help of the preprocessor directive `#include`.

- Preprocessor directive instruct the compiler that these files need to be processed before the compilation.

1. `stdio.h`: It is a header file in the C programming language that stands for **standard input-output header**. It contains declarations for input and output functions used for tasks like reading from the keyboard, writing to the screen, and working with files.

## Keywords:

- You cannot have a variable named as keywords.
